There is one deck, three players: "Curly" (you), "Mo" and "Larry". Try to get a sum of as close to 21 as possible without going
"bust" (going over 21). Each player is initially dealt two cards. Click your previously dealt cards to be dealt another (hit). When
you are as close to 21 as you dare, click "No More Hits" and see who won the round. To be dealt another round, click "Deal Again". 
Ace is worth 1 point, face cards (Jack, Queen and King) are worth 10 points. ALl other cards are worth their nominal value. Mo and
Larry count cards and will only take a hit if the probability of going bust is below a certain percent. It remains to be seen what 
that percentage needs to be to give them any significant advantage.
